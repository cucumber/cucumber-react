# Cucumber-React

React components for rendering Gherkin documents and Cucumber results.

This library also contains a [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) reducer that
builds an [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) state using
[Event Protocol](../event-protocol) events as
[Redux actions](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html)
